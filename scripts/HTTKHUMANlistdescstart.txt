These chemicals are available for toxicokinetic prediction in the  <A HREF="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httk/">R package "httk"</A>. Each chemical has experimentally-measured hepatic metabolic clearance and plasma protein binding data. These data have been either curated from the literature or measured by EPA, its contractors, and collaborators. These data, along with physicochemical properties, can be used to make chemical-specific predictions with the suite of generic toxicokinetic models offered by “httk”. “httk” includes a <A HREF="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004">population variability simulator that draws from NHANES biometrics</A> and allows for <A HREF="https://doi.org/10.1080/17425255.2021.1935867">in vitro-to-in vivo (IVIVE) extrapolation of high throughput screening data</A>.
