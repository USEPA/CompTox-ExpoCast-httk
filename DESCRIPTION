Title: High-Throughput Toxicokinetics
Description: Functions and data tables for simulation and statistical analysis 
             of chemical toxicokinetics ("TK") as in Pearce et al. (2017) 
             <doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i04>. Chemical-specific in vitro 
             data have been obtained from relatively high throughput 
             experiments. Both physiologically-based ("PBTK") and empirical 
             (e.g., one compartment) "TK" models can be parameterized for 
             several hundred chemicals and multiple species. These models are 
             solved efficiently, often using compiled (C-based) code. A Monte 
             Carlo sampler is included for simulating biological variability 
             (Ring et al., 2017 <doi:10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004>) 
             and measurement limitations. Calibrated methods are included for 
             predicting tissue:plasma partition coefficients and volume of 
             distribution 
             (Pearce et al., 2017 <doi:10.1007/s10928-017-9548-7>). 
             These functions and data provide a set of tools for 
             in vitro-in vivo extrapolation ("IVIVE") of high throughput 
             screening data (e.g., Tox21, ToxCast) to real-world exposures via 
             reverse dosimetry (also known as "RTK") 
             (Wetmore et al., 2015 <doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfv171>).
