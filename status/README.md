# Scripts for Coordinating HTTK Chemical-Specific In Vitro Measurments

As various research organizations collect new chemical-specific in vitro data
characterizing toxicokinetics, we have tried to maintain a list of which
chemicals are being tested and by whom, so that we can minimize redundancy
unless required by design.
