#' Return the assumptions used in Honda et al. 2019
#' 
#' This function returns four of the better performing sets of assumptions evaluated in Honda et al. 2019 
#' (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217564).These include four different combinations of hepatic clearance assumption, in vivo bioactivity assumption, 
#' and relevant tissue assumption. Generally, this function is not called directly by the user, but instead
#' called by setting the IVIVE option in calc_mc_oral_equiv, calc_mc_css, and calc_analytic functions. Currently, these IVIVE option 
#' is not implemented the solve_1comp etc. functions.
#' 
#' @param method This is set to one of "Honda1", "Honda2", "Honda3", or "Honda4".
#' @param tissue This is only relevant to "Honda4" and indicates the relevant tissue compartment.
#' @return A list of tissue, bioactive.free.invivo, and restrictive.clearance assumptions.
#' 
#' @details
#'
#' Only four sets of IVIVE assumptions that performed well in Honda et al. 
#' (2019) are currently included:
#' \"Honda1\" through \"Honda4\". The use of max (peak)  
#' concentration can not be currently be calculated with calc_analytic_css. The 
#' httk default settings correspond to "Honda3":

#' "Honda1" uses plasma concentration, restrictive clearance, and treats the 
#' unbound invivo concentration as bioactive. For IVIVE, any input nominal 
#' concentration in vitro should be converted to cfree.invitro using 
#' \code{\link{armitage_eval}}, otherwise performance will be the same as 
#' "Honda2".
