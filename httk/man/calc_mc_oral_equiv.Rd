\description{
This function converts a chemical plasma concetration to an oral adminstered
equivalent
dose (AED) using a concentration obtained from \code{\link{calc_mc_css}}.  
This function uses reverse dosimetry-based 
'\emph{in vitro-in vivo} extrapolation (IVIVE) 
for high throughput risk screening.  The user can input the
chemical and \emph{in vitro} bioactive concentration, select the TK
model, and then automatically predict the \emph{in vivo} AED
which would produce a body concentration equal to
the \emph{in vitro} bioactive concentration. This function relies on the
Monte Carlo method (via funcion \code{\link{create_mc_samples}} to simulate
both uncertainty and variability so that the result is a distribution of
equivalent doses, from which we provide specific quantiles
(specified by \code{which.quantile}), though the full set of predictions can
be obtained by setting \code{return.samples} to \code{TRUE}.
}
\details{
The chemical-specific steady-state concentration for a dose rate of 
1 mg/kg body weight/day can be used for in IVIVE of
a bioactive \emph{in vitro} concentration by dividing the \emph{in vitro}
concentration
by the steady-state concentration to predict a dose rate (mg/kg/day) that
would produce that concentration in plasma. Using quantiles of the 
distribution (such as the upper 95th percentile) allow incorporation of 
uncertainty and variability into IVIVE.

This approach relies on thelinearity
of the models to calculate a scaling factor to relate in vitro
concentrations (uM) with AED. The scaling factor is the
inverse of the steady-state plasma concentration (Css) predicted
for a 1 mg/kg/day exposure dose rate
where \emph{in vitro} concentration [X] and Css must be in the same
units. Note that it is typical for \emph{in vitro} concentrations to be
reported in units of uM and Css in units of mg/L, in which case
one must be converted to the other. 

Reverse Dosimetry Toxicodynamic IVIVE

Figure from Breen et al. (2021) (\doi{10.1080/17425255.2021.1935867}) shows 
reverse dosimetry toxicodynamic IVIVE. Equivalent external dose is
determined by solving the TK model in reverse by deriving the external dose
(that is, TK model input) that produces a specified internal concentration 
(that is, TK model output). Reverse dosimetry and IVIVE using HTTK relies on 
the linearity of the models. We calculate a scaling factor to relate 
\emph{in vitro} 
concentrations (uM) to AEDs. The scaling 
factor is the inverse of the Css 
predicted for a 1 mg/kg/day exposure dose rate. We use Monte Carlo to 
simulate variability and propagate uncertainty; for example, to calculate an 
upper 95th percentile Css,95 for individuals who get higher plasma 
concentrations from the same exposure.

The Monte Carlo methods used here were recently updated and described by
Breen et al. (submitted).

All arguments after httkpop only apply if httkpop is set to TRUE and species
to "Human".

When species is specified as rabbit, dog, or mouse, the function uses the
appropriate physiological data(volumes and flows) but substitutes human
fraction unbound, partition coefficients, and intrinsic hepatic clearance.

Tissue concentrations are calculated for the pbtk model with oral infusion
dosing.  All tissues other than gut, liver, and lung are the product of the
steady state plasma concentration and the tissue to plasma partition
coefficient.

Only four sets of IVIVE assumptions that performed well in Honda et al. 
(2019) are currently included in \code{\link{honda.ivive}}:
"Honda1" through "Honda4". The use of max (peak) 
concentration can not be currently be calculated with \code{\link{calc_analytic_css}}. 
The httk default settings correspond to "Honda3":

\tabular{lrrrrr}{
\tab \emph{In Vivo} Conc. \tab Metabolic Clearance \tab Bioactive Chemical Conc. \emph{In Vivo} \tab TK Statistic Used* \tab Bioactive Chemical Conc. \emph{In Vitro} \cr
Honda1 \tab Veinous (Plasma) \tab Restrictive \tab Free \tab Mean Conc. In Vivo \tab Free Conc. In Vitro \cr
Honda2 \tab Veinous \tab Restrictive \tab Free \tab Mean Conc. In Vivo \tab Nominal Conc. In Vitro \cr
Honda3 \tab Veinous \tab Restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. In Vivo \tab Nominal Conc. In Vitro \cr
Honda4 \tab Target Tissue \tab Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. In Vivo \tab Nominal Conc. In Vitro \cr
}

"Honda1" uses plasma concentration, restrictive clearance, and treats the 
unbound invivo concentration as bioactive. For IVIVE, any input nominal 
concentration in vitro should be converted to cfree.invitro using 
\code{\link{armitage_eval}}, otherwise performance will be the same as 
"Honda2".
=======
The six sets of plausible IVIVE
assumptions identified by Honda et al. (2019) 
(\doi{10.1371/journal.pone.0217564}) 
are: \tabular{lrrrr}{
\tab \emph{in vivo} Conc. \tab Metabolic Clearance \tab Bioactive Chemical
Conc. \tab TK Statistic Used* \cr Honda1 \tab Veinous (Plasma) \tab
Restrictive \tab Free \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda2 \tab Veinous \tab
Restrictive \tab Free \tab Max Conc. \cr Honda3 \tab Veinous \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda4 \tab Veinous \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Max Conc. \cr Honda5 \tab Target Tissue \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda6 \tab Target Tissue
\tab Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Max Conc. \cr } *Assumption is
currently ignored because analytical steady-state solutions are currently
used by this function.
