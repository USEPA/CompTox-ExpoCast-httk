Frechen et al. (2021) includes compiled literature descriptions of 
toxicokinetic summary statistics, including time-integrated plasma 
concentrations (area under the curve or AUC) for drugs administered to a 
sample of subjects including both pregnant and non-pregnant women. The 
circumstances of the dosing varied slightly between drugs and are summarized 
in the table.
