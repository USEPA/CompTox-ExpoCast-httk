\description{
This table records the historical performance and other metrics 
of the R package "httk" as
profiled with the function \code{\link{benchmark_httk}}. There is a row for
each version and a column for each benchmark or metric. This table is used
to generate graphs comparing the current version to past performance in order
to help identify unintended degradtion of package capabilities.
