\usage{
parameterize_fetal_pbtk(
  chem.cas = NULL,
  chem.name = NULL,
  dtxsid = NULL,
  species = "Human",
  fetal_fup_adjustment = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chem.cas}{Either the chemical name or the CAS number must be
specified.}

\item{chem.name}{Either the chemical name or the CAS number must be
specified.}

\item{dtxsid}{EPA's DSSTox Structure ID (\url{http://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard})
the chemical must be identified by either CAS, name, or DTXSIDs}

\item{species}{Species desired (either "Rat", "Rabbit", "Dog", "Mouse", or
default "Human"). Currently only a narrow human model is supported.}

\item{fetal_fup_adjustment}{Logical indicator of whether to use an adjusted
estimate for fetal fup based on the fetal:maternal plasma protein binding
ratios presented in McNamara and Alcorn's 2002 study "Protein Binding
Predictions in Infants." Defaults to TRUE.}
