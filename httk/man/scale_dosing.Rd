\usage{
scale_dosing(dosing, parameters, route, output.units = "uM")
}
\arguments{
\item{dosing}{List of dosing metrics used in simulation, which must include
the general entries with names "initial.dose", "doses.per.day", 
"daily.dose", and "dosing.matrix". The "dosing.matrix" is used for more
precise dose regimen specification, and is a matrix consisting of two
columns or rows named "time" and "dose" containing the time and amount,
in mg/kg BW, of each dose. The minimal usage case involves all entries but
"initial.dose" set to NULL in value.}

\item{parameters}{Chemical parameters from parameterize_pbtk function,
overrides chem.name and chem.cas.}

\item{route}{String specification of route of exposure for simulation:
"oral", "iv", "inhalation", ...}

\item{output.units}{Desired units (either "mg/L", "mg", "umol", or default
"uM").}
}
\value{
A list of numeric values for doses converted to output.units, potentially
(depending on argument dosing) including:
\item{initial.dose}{The first dose given}
\item{dosing.matrix}{A 2xN matrix where the first column is dose time and
the second is dose amount for N doses}
\item{daily.dose}{The total cumulative daily dose}
}
\description{
This function transforms the dose (in mg/kg) into the appropriate units. It
handles single doses, matrices of doses, or daily repeated doses at varying
intervals. Gut absorption is also factored in through the parameter Fgutabs,
and scaling is currently avoided in the inhalation exposure case with a 
scale factor of 1
