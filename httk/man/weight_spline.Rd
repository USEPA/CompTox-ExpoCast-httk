\title{Smoothing splines for natural-log weight vs. age, by race and gender.}
\format{
A list with 10 elements, named for unique combinations of gender
 ("Male" and "Female") and NHANES race/ethnicity categories ("Mexican
 American", "Non-Hispanic White", "Non-Hispanic Black", "Other", and "Other
 Hispanic"). Each list element consists of an object of class
 \code{smooth.spline.fit} (output of \code{\link[stats]{smooth.spline}})
 which can be used with method \code{\link[stats]{predict.smooth.spline}} to
 predict natural-log weight from age in months. The smoothing splines
 were fitted to NHANES data for each combination of NHANES gender and
 race/ethnicity categories: natural-log weight vs. age in months,
 weighted using the NHANES sample weights. Weight is in kg.
