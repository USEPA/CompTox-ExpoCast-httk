\usage{
httkpop_direct_resample(
  nsamp = NULL,
  gendernum = NULL,
  agelim_years = c(0, 79),
  agelim_months = c(0, 959),
  weight_category = c("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", "Obese"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nsamp}{The desired number of individuals in the virtual population.
\code{nsamp} need not be provided if \code{gendernum} is provided.}

\item{gendernum}{Optional: A named list giving the numbers of male and
female individuals to include in the population, e.g. \code{list(Male=100,
Female=100)}. Default is NULL, meaning both males and females are included,
in their proportions in the NHANES data. If both \code{nsamp} and
\code{gendernum} are provided, they must agree (i.e., \code{nsamp} must be
the sum of \code{gendernum}).}

\item{agelim_years}{Optional: A two-element numeric vector giving the
minimum and maximum ages (in years) to include in the population. Default is
c(0,79). If \code{agelim_years} is provided and \code{agelim_months} is not,
\code{agelim_years} will override the default value of \code{agelim_months}.}

\item{agelim_months}{Optional: A two-element numeric vector giving the
minimum and maximum ages (in months) to include in the population. Default
is c(0, 959), equivalent to the default \code{agelim_years}. If
\code{agelim_months} is provided and \code{agelim_years} is not,
agelim_months will override the default values of \code{agelim_years}.}

\item{weight_category}{Optional: The weight categories to include in the
population. Default is \code{c('Underweight', 'Normal', 'Overweight',
'Obese')}. User-supplied vector must contain one or more of these strings.}

\item{gfr_category}{The kidney function categories to include in the
population. Default is \code{c('Normal','Kidney Disease', 'Kidney Failure')}
to include all kidney function levels.}

\item{reths}{Optional: a character vector giving the races/ethnicities to
include in the population. Default is \code{c('Mexican American','Other
Hispanic','Non-Hispanic White','Non-Hispanic Black','Other')}, to include
all races and ethnicities in their proportions in the NHANES data.
User-supplied vector must contain one or more of these strings.}

\item{gfr_resid_var}{Logical value indicating whether or not to include
residual variability when generating GFR values. (Default is TRUE.)}

\item{ckd_epi_race_coeff}{Logical value indicating whether or not to use the
"race coefficient" from the CKD-EPI equation when estimating GFR values.
(Default is FALSE.)}

\item{nhanes_mec_svy}{\code{surveydesign} object created from
\code{\link{mecdt}} using \code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} (this is done in
\code{\link{httkpop_generate}})}
}
\value{

column represents a demographic, anthropometric, or physiological parameter.
