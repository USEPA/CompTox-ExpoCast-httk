\description{
This data set contains values from Schmitt (2008) and Ruark et al. (2014)
describing the composition of specific tissues and from Birnbaum et al.
(1994) describing volumes of and blood flows to those tissues, allowing
parameterization of toxicokinetic models for human, mouse, rat, dog, or
rabbit. Tissue volumes were calculated by converting the fractional mass of
each tissue with its density (both from ICRP), lumping the remaining tissues
into the rest-of-body, excluding the mass of the gastrointestinal contents
