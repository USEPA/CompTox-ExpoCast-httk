\description{
For a given chemical and fixed dose rate this function determines a 
distribution of steady-state concentrations reflecting measurment uncertainty
an population variability. Uncertainty and variability are simulated via the
Monte Carlo method -- many sets of model parameters are drawn according to
probability distributions described in 
Ring et al. (2017) (\doi{10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004})
for human variability and Wambaugh et al. (2019) 
(\doi{10.1093/toxsci/kfz205}) 
for measurement uncertainty. Monte Carlo samples are generated by the 
function \code{\link{create_mc_samples}}. To allow rapid application of the 
Monte Carlo 
method we make use of analytical solutions for the steady-state concentration
for a particular model via a given route (when available) as opposed to
solving the model numerically (that is, using differential equations).
For each sample of the Monte Carlo method (as specified by argument
\code{samples}) the parameters for the analytical solution are varied. An
ensemble of steady-state predictions are produced, though by default only
the quantiles specified by argument \code{which.quantile} are provided. If 
the full set of predicted values are desired use set the argument 
\code{return.samples} to \code{TRUE}.
}
\details{
The chemical-specific steady-state concentration for a dose rate of 
1 mg/kg body weight/day can be used for in \emph{in vitro-in vivo} 
extrapolation (IVIVE) of
a bioactive \emph{in vitro} concentration by dividing the \emph{in vitro}
concentration
by the steady-state concentration to predict a dose rate (mg/kg/day) that
would produce that concentration in plasma. Using quantiles of the 
distribution (such as the upper 95th percentile) allow incorporation of 
uncertainty and variability into IVIVE.

Reverse Dosimetry Toxicodynamic IVIVE

Figure from Breen et al. (2021) (\doi{10.1080/17425255.2021.1935867}) shows 
reverse dosimetry toxicodynamic IVIVE. Equivalent external dose is
determined by solving the TK model in reverse by deriving the external dose
(that is, TK model input) that produces a specified internal concentration 
(that is, TK model output). Reverse dosimetry and IVIVE using HTTK relies on 
the linearity of the models. We calculate a scaling factor to relate 
\emph{in vitro} 
concentrations (uM) to administered equivalent doses (AED). The scaling 
factor is the inverse of the steady state plasma concentration (Css) 
predicted for a 1 mg/kg/day exposure dose rate. We use Monte Carlo to 
simulate variability and propagate uncertainty; for example, to calculate an 
upper 95th percentile Css,95 for individuals who get higher plasma 
concentrations from the same exposure.

The Monte Carlo methods used here were recently updated and described by
Breen et al. (submitted).


httk-pop is used only for humans. For non-human species biological 
variability is simulated by drawing parameters from uncorellated log-normal
distributions. 

Chemical-specific httk data are available primarily for human and for a few
hundred chemicals in rat. All in silico predictions are for human. Thus, 
when species is specified as rabbit, dog, or mouse, the user can choose
to set the argument \code{default.to.human} to \code{TRUE} so that this 
function uses the
appropriate physiological data (volumes and flows) but substitutes human
fraction unbound, partition coefficients, and intrinsic hepatic clearance.

If the argument \code{tissue} is used, the steady-state concentration in that
tissue, if available, is provided. If that tissue is included in the model
used (specified by arguement \code{model}) then the actual tissue 
concentration is
provided. Otherwise, the tissue-specific partition coefficient is used to
estimate the concentration from the plasma. 

The six sets of plausible IVIVE
assumptions identified by Honda et al. (2019) 
(\doi{10.1371/journal.pone.0217564}) 
are: \tabular{lrrrr}{
\tab \emph{in vivo} Conc. \tab Metabolic Clearance \tab Bioactive Chemical
Conc. \tab TK Statistic Used* \cr Honda1 \tab Veinous (Plasma) \tab
Restrictive \tab Free \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda2 \tab Veinous \tab

Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda4 \tab Veinous \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Max Conc. \cr Honda5 \tab Target Tissue \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda6 \tab Target Tissue
\tab Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Max Conc. \cr } *Assumption is
currently ignored because analytical steady-state solutions are currently
used by this function.
