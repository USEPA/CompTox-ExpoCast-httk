\title{Measured Caco-2 Apical-Basal Permeability Data}
\format{
An object of class \code{data.frame} with 634 rows and 5 columns.

\usage{

\description{
In vitro Caco-2 membrane permeabilities characterize how readily absobed/transported
a chemical is. These measurements are all for the apical-to-basal Caco-2
orientation.
These data were either measured by EPA or collected by other others, as
indicated by the column 'Data Origin'.
Anywhere that the values is reported by three numbers separated by a comma 
(this also happens for plasma protein binding) the three values are: median, 
lower 95 percent confidence intervals, upper 95 percent confidence interval. Unless you are 
doing monte carlo work it makes sense to ignore the second and third values.
