\value{
A matrix of class deSolve with a column for time(in days), each
compartment, the area under the curve, and plasma concentration and a row

}
\description{
This function solves for the amounts or concentrations of a chemical
in different tissues as functions of time as a result of inhalation 
exposure to an ideal gas.
}
\details{
The default dosing scheme involves a specification of the start time
of exposure (exp.start.time), the concentration of gas inhaled (exp.conc),
the period of a cycle of exposure and non-exposure (period), the
duration of the exposure during that period (exp.duration), and the total
days simulated. Together,these arguments determine the "forcings" passed to
the ODE integrator. Forcings can also be specified manually, or effectively
turned off by setting exposure concentration to zero, if the user prefers to 
simulate dosing by other means. 

The "forcings" object is configured to be passed to the integrator with,
at the most, a basic unit conversion among ppmv, mg/L, and uM. No scaling by
BW is set to be performed on the forcings series.

Note that the model parameters have units of hours while the model output is
in days.

Default NULL value for doses.per.day solves for a single dose.

The compartments used in this model are the gut lumen, gut, liver, kidneys,
veins, arteries, lungs, and the rest of the body.

The extra compartments include the amounts or concentrations metabolized by
the liver and excreted by the kidneys through the tubules.

AUC is the area under the curve of the plasma concentration.

Model parameters are named according to the following convention:\tabular{lrrrr}{
prefix \tab suffic \tab Meaning \tab units \cr
K \tab \tab Partition coefficient for tissue to free plasma \ tab unitless \cr
V \tab \tab Volume \tab L \cr
Q \tab \tab Flow \tab L/h \cr
k \tab \tab Rate \tab 1/h \cr
\tab c \tab Parameter is proportional to body weight \tab 1 / kg for volumes
and 1/kg^(3/4) for flows \cr}

When species is specified but chemical-specific in vitro data are not
available, the function uses the appropriate physiological data (volumes and 
flows) but default.to.human = TRUE must be used to substitute human
fraction unbound, partition coefficients, and intrinsic hepatic clearance.
