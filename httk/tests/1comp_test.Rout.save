Human volume of distribution returned in units of L/kg BW.
None of the monitored components undergo unit conversions  (i.e. conversion factor of 1).

AUC is area under the plasma concentration curve in uM*days units with Rblood2plasma = 0.77.
The model outputs are provided in the following units:
	umol: Agutlumen, Ametabolized
	uM: Ccompartment
	uM*days: AUC
