Warning messages:
1: In get_cheminfo() :
  Excluding compounds that have one or more needed parameters missing in chem.physical_and_invitro.table.

For model 3compartmentss each chemical must have non-NA values for:Human.Clint, Human.Funbound.plasma, logP, MW
2: In get_cheminfo() :
  Excluding compounds without a 'fup' value (i.e. fup value = NA).
3: In get_cheminfo() :
  Excluding compounds with uncertain 'fup' confidence/credible intervals.
4: In get_cheminfo() :
  Excluding compounds that do not have a clint value or distribution of clint values.
5: In get_cheminfo() :
  Excluding volatile compounds defined as log.Henry >= -4.5.
