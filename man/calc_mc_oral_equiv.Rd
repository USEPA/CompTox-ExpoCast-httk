\usage{
calc_mc_oral_equiv(conc, chem.name = NULL, chem.cas = NULL,
  which.quantile = 0.95, species = "Human", input.units = "uM",
  output.units = "mg", suppress.messages = F, return.samples = F,
  restrictive.clearance = T, plasma.binding = F,
  tk.statistic.used = "mean", tissue = NULL, IVIVE = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{conc}{Bioactive in vitro concentration in units of uM. %% ~~Describe
\code{ssparams.i} here~~}

\item{chem.name}{Either the chemical name or the CAS number must be
specified. %% ~~Describe \code{obs} here~~}

\item{chem.cas}{Either the CAS number or the chemical name must be
specified. %% ~~Describe \code{pred} here~~}

\item{which.quantile}{Which quantile from Monte Carlo steady-state
simulation (calc_mc_css) is requested. Can be a vector. Note that 95th
concentration quantile is the same population as the 5th dose quantile. %%
~~Describe \code{ssparams.mean} here~~}

\item{species}{Species desired (either "Rat", "Rabbit", "Dog", "Mouse", or
default "Human").  %% ~~Describe \code{ssparams.var.inv} here~~}

\item{input.units}{Units of given concentration, default of uM but can also
be mg/L.}

\item{output.units}{Units of dose, default of 'mg' for mg/kg BW/ day or
'mol' for mol/ kg BW/ day.}

\item{suppress.messages}{Suppress text messages. %% ~~Describe \code{sds}
here~~}

\item{return.samples}{Whether or not to return the vector containing the
samples from the simulation instead of the selected quantile.}

\item{restrictive.clearance}{Protein binding not taken into account (set to
1) in liver clearance if FALSE.}

\item{plasma.binding}{If TRUE, then only the free (unbound) fraction of
chemical is considered to be bioactive. If FALSE, the total chemical
concentration is used for IVIVE. (Default TRUE)}

\item{tk.statistic.used}{Theoreticially either the "mean" or "max"imum
(peak) concetrations might be used for IVIVE with some models. Defaults to
"mean". Meaningless for the steady-state model (Argument is currently
ignored because analytic steady-state solutions are used by this function.).}

\item{tissue}{Desired steady state tissue conentration.}

\item{IVIVE}{Honda et al. (submitted) identified six plausible sets of
assumptions for \emph{in vitro-in vivo} extrapolation (IVIVE) assumptions.
Argument may be set to "Honda1" through "Honda6". If used, this function
overwrites the tissue, restrictive.clearance, and plasma.binding arguments.
See Details below for more information.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to calc_mc_css for httkpop and
variance of parameters.}

\description{
This functions converts a chemical plasma concetration to an oral equivalent
dose using a concentration obtained from calc_mc_css.  %% ~~ A concise (1-5
lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\details{
All arguments after httkpop only apply if httkpop is set to TRUE and species
to "Human".

When species is specified as rabbit, dog, or mouse, the function uses the
appropriate physiological data(volumes and flows) but substitues human
fraction unbound, partition coefficients, and intrinsic hepatic clearance.

Tissue concentrations are calculated for the pbtk model with oral infusion
dosing.  All tissues other than gut, liver, and lung are the product of the
steady state plasma concentration and the tissue to plasma partition
coefficient.

The six sets of plausible \emph{in vitro-in vivo} extrpolation (IVIVE)
assumptions identified by Honda et al. (submitted) are: \tabular{lrrrr}{
\tab \emph{in vivo} Conc. \tab Metabolic Clearance \tab Bioactive Chemical
Conc. \tab TK Statistic Used* \cr Honda1 \tab Veinous (Plasma) \tab
Restrictive \tab Free \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda2 \tab Veinous \tab
Restrictive \tab Free \tab Max Conc. \cr Honda3 \tab Veinous \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda4 \tab Veinous \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Max Conc. \cr Honda5 \tab Target Tissue \tab
Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Mean Conc. \cr Honda6 \tab Target Tissue
\tab Non-restrictive \tab Total \tab Max Conc. \cr } *Assumption is
currently ignored because analytical steady-state solutions are currently
used by this function.
