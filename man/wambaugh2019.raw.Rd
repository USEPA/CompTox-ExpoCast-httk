\description{
These data are the new HTTK in vitro data for chemicals reported in Wambaugh
et al. (submitted) They
are the output of different Bayesian models evaluated to compare using a
single protein concentration vs. the new three concentration titration
protocol. These data summarize the results of Bayesian analysis of the in vitro
toxicokinetic experiments conducted by Cyprotex to characterize fraction 
unbound in the presence of pooled human plasma protein and the intrnsic 
hepatic clearance of the chemical by pooled human hepatocytes.
This file includes replicates (diferent CompoundName id's but same chemical')
