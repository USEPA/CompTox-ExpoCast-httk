\title{Convert HTTK-Pop-generated parameters to HTTK physiological parameters}
\usage{
httkpop_bio(indiv_dt)
}
\arguments{
\item{indiv_dt}{The data.table object returned by \code{httkpop_generate()}}
}
\value{
A data.table with the physiological parameters expected by any HTTK 
  model, including body weight (BW), hematocrit, tissue volumes per kg body
  weight, tissue flows as fraction of CO, CO per (kg BW)^3/4, GFR per (kg
  BW)^3/4, portal vein flow per (kg BW)^3/4, and liver density.
