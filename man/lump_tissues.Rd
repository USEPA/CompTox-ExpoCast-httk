\title{Lump tissue parameters}
\usage{
lump_tissues(Ktissue2pu.in, tissuelist = NULL, species = "Human")
}
\arguments{
\item{Ktissue2pu.in}{List of partition coefficients from
predict_partitioning_schmitt.}

\item{tissuelist}{Specifies compartment names and tissues groupings.
Remaining tissues in tissue.data are lumped in the rest of the body.}

\item{species}{Species desired (either "Rat", "Rabbit", "Dog", "Mouse", or
default "Human").}
}
\value{
\item{Krbc2pu}{Ratio of concentration of chemical in red blood cells
to unbound concentration in plasma.} \item{Krest2pu}{Ratio of concentration
of chemical in rest of body tissue to unbound concentration in plasma.}
\item{Vrestc}{ Volume of the rest of the body per kg body weight, L/kg BW.}
\item{Vliverc}{ Volume of the liver per kg body weight, L/kg BW.}
\item{Qtotal.liverf}{Fraction of cardiac output flowing to the gut and
liver, i.e. out of the liver.} \item{Qgutf}{Fraction of cardiac output
flowing to the gut.} \item{Qkidneyf}{Fraction of cardiac output flowing to
the kidneys.}
}
\description{
%% ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~ This
function takes the parameters from predict_partitioning_schmitt and lumps
the partition coefficients along with the volumes and flows based on the
given tissue list. It is useful in Monte Carlo simulation of individual
partition coefficients when calculating the rest of body partition
coefficient.

\examples{

pcs <- predict_partitioning_schmitt(chem.name='bisphenola')
tissuelist <- list(liver=c("liver"),kidney=c("kidney"),lung=c("lung"),gut=c("gut")
,muscle.bone=c('muscle','bone'))
lump_tissues(pcs,tissuelist=tissuelist)
